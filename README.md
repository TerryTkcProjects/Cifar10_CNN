# Machine Learning Project: Hyperparameter Optimization for Neural Network

**Summary**
- Updated the architecture and parameters to achieve maximum accuracy in classifying the DIFAR-10 datasets.
- Successfully achieved top 5 highest accuracy in class.

We are required to use the file Cifar10 [dataset](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html) to load the 5 classes which includes all animals except frogs.
Our goal is to update the architecture and/or parameters to achieve maximum accuracy.
